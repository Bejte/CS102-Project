# Catastrophe Compass
## Description

As observed from disasters happening worldwide, knowledge is crucial to saving lives.
Regrettably, several occurrences of natural disasters, such as the recent earthquake in Turkey &
Syria, have exposed the fact that important information occasionally fails to transmit efficiently.
In Catastrophe Compass, we strive to establish a system that transmits information effectively.
By guaranteeing a proper communication channel among different teams and individuals, such
as single volunteers, and governmental & non-governmental organizations, our development
team aims to boost the effectiveness of post-disaster management. Additionally, by presenting a
hybrid algorithm, we plan to automate the allocation of humanitarian assistance to locations in
need and teams of volunteers to workplaces.

## Setup

Pinecone, GCP, OpenWeather and Firebase is used in the project. API keys are removed due tÄ±o the free trial usage and cloud functions are needed to depoleyd to GCP.
